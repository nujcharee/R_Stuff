This is a large health centre and there is plenty of choice. You register with one particular GP but may see whomever you please. However, not every doctor in the practice has the helpful manner mentioned above. There was one particular instance where one GP was brusque, bordering on downright rude, with my son.

This appointment was not with the normal GP and my son's presenting complaint (a back injury) was most definitely genuine and warranted. The appointment was held on time and we were ready when called. However, upon walking in my son was rushed through a series of barked instructions and sent on his way. Given that he had another much more sensitive issue (depression) to discuss and flagged this clearly upon his arrival, it really was not helpful to be told "well there isn't usually time in a ten-minute appointment to cover two things, but OK go on".

In the end, I enquired pointedly whether this doctor was having a bad day. It was, they responded, due to unfamiliarity with the IT system.
