1.  Car Parking:  It can be very difficult to get a car parking space. There are 2 disabled parling spaces and because of the parking problem, drivers who do not display any disabled parling disc use the disabled parking facility.   When mentioned to receptionists, they are not interested.   Car parking for patients is restricted because of the number of non-medical staff using the car park.
2.  Over the last 3-4 years, I  have NEVER - apart from 1 isolated occasion when a cancelled appointment  became free - been able to get an appointment to see my own GP (ie the one with whom I am registered and prefer to see) within the 48 hour deadline.  Normally I am offered an appointment to see my GP anytime between SEVEN AND FOURTEEN DAYS IN ADVANCE.  I am always able to see another doctor in the practice within 48 hours but other GPs are not readily familiar with my long-term illnesses and treatments.
