I would like to start by saying that the majority of staff in the practice are lovely, but there are others who are consistantly rude when on the telephone.  
I have also experienced the "so-called" telephone lines queuing system, and have many times sat patiently being told that my call is in a queue only to be cut off before i get through - disgusted!
