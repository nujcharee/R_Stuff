It's been a year since I have been with this  Group Practice, I have called in for appointments on several occasions. However, the appointments I could get was only in a week's time or they told me to go somewhere else. In fact, at the moment I do not have any GP. This year,  I have only been able to get one appointment with this Group practice. It is frustrating, that when you are sick you are unable to see any doctor given that you are duly paying your taxes....
