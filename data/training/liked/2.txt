I had tried to register at this surgery as my husband was registered there but the receptionist was quite rude and said we are short of staff so we cant take you in now.  Despite me having called them the day before to ask if it was ok to come and register.  Secondly it is ridiculous that they only register patient on tuesday between certain 2 hours afetr 11.00 which make it very inconvenient for everyone working.   When they finally regsitered me, they got my name wrong on NHS card for which when i phoned the receptionist was so rude saying she doesnt deal with name changes.  I am quite upset at the fact that my previous surgery gave such excellent service , but as i moved home i had to change.
