Whenever I contact reception either by phone or in person I always get a very polite and helpful response.
 I usually see one particular doctor, but all the doctors have the same high standard 
 I am made to feel that I can have as long as I need. 
On occasions when I need to see the nurse I also have the same high standard of service & care.
