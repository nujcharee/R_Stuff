Whenever I ring the practice or call in person the receptionists are always very polite and helpfull. When you see the doctor you always have as much time as you need which is why if my appointment is ever late I realise it is because another patient is gettng good treatment. I belong to several stroke groups and listening to other peoples experience with their doctors I think my doctors are the best! The only time I have to wait for an appointment is if I want to see a paricular doctor otherwise a appointment is always available. If I need to see a doctor urgently I know I can go and wait to see the duty doctor.
