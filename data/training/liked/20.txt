Having complained about this surgery previously, I would like to take the opportunity to thank them for the improvements which have been made over the past couple of months.

With a 6 month old, we have called/visited the surgery a number of times over Christmas and I was also quite ill. On all occasions we had a good experience end to end. The receptionists were helpful on the phone as well as in the surgery and the GPs were great - as usual.

The nurse I visited in the smoking clinic was also excellent and I even got a courtesy call to see how I was getting on.

They are also handing out an information sheet with a whole list of great improvements which they have made or will be making shortly - for example booking telephone appointments with the GP.
