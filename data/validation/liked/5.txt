The GPs here are of variable quality, but most are truly helpful and attentive. I can always get through on reception, and when I have asked for doctors to call me back on the day they always do and are usually pretty helpful. The building is beautiful and a really nice space. I don't mean to be too negative because it is clear the staff are doing their best.
