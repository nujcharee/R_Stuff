Whenever I contact reception either by phone or in person I always get a very polite and helpful response. I usually see one particular doctor but all the doctors have the same high standard - I am made to feel that I can have as long as I need. On occasions when I need to see a nurse they also have the same high standard of care. I have relatives who go to two other Practices in Southwark and the care they receive is not as good as Albion Street. I belong to several Stroke Groups and End of Life Care Groups where I meet people from various Practices across Lambeth and Southwark and none of them get anywhere near the quality of care that I receive from the staff at Albion Street Group Practice!
