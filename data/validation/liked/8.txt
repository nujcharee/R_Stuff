I'm new to the town so went for a new patient appointment at this surgery.  Gave my medical history. The nurse took a test of my wee sample and wanted to send it off urgently and seemed very concerned. I had just explained to them that I have kidney disease and have to be monitered by the hospital. I was given a form for blood tests and to go to a particular place to have them done.  As far as I was concerned this place could have been the otherside of the world.  No instructions where given on how to find this place.  No referral to the hospital has been made to keep check on my kidney disease and no one has chased up for my blood tests.  All in all not and adequate surgery.
