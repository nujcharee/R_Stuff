they couldnt give me a date to see someone within 4 weeks as i was nhs fee paying. then when i finally got to the appointment date, in agony for 4 weeks, they had booked it incorrectly for the evening and told me to come back in 4 hours. i didn't even want to ask them to book me a taxi as the staff seemed incredibly rude
