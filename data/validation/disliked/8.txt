My daughter is 14 months old and 6 times during the 14 months we have tried to get a GP to see her, for different issues. On every occassion it has been impossible to get an appointment with a GP when she has been unwell. Each day the appointments are fully booked. The advice from the receptionist is always to phone back the next morning (the phone line is constantly engaged, and when connected told again the appointments are full) or to use a local walk in centre. The only times we have managed to get an appointment has been when booked in advance, typically 5 days later.
