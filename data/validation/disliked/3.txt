This is the second time when I come across staff on the phone that shouldn't be working there, because they clearly are not service minded.

I called earlier today, 9.40am to the bookings for the day to try and get a booking as soon as possible. I've not had much sleep throughout the night because of severe ache. I contacted NHS 24-hours that made an assessment and told me to contact a GP asap.

I was told by the woman doing bookings that they were fully booked today. I asked if I could book for another day, but she said I can either have a doctor calling me for an assessment or call again at 8.15am tomorrow morning. When I said there must be a way to pre book for other days, she started being stubborn, sounding enoyed and without compassion. She kept giving me the options, sounding like a robot, rather then a compassionate human being trying to go the extra mile.
