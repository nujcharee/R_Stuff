Health Visitors are shocking. There are no words to describe how poor they are without being offensive. Lack of advice, incorrect information (as confirmed by the GP at the same surgery), rude and impatient.

In the main, the reception staff are rude and impatient. A couple of them are very nice however and apologies to them for this review.
