This is a terrible surgery. I have always had a bad experience but did not feel the need to make a formal complaint until now. I have been a patient of this surgery for quite a while and still feel like a stranger as I am always seeing a different GP that ask me the same questions all the time and each one makes me feel I need to rush off.

I was diagnosed with asthma last year and felt the care I received was so bad I flew to Germany for 2nd diagnosis which disagreed with the diagnosis here. I went back the the surgery to ask if they could recheck and I was told no and when I have taken tests here in the past, they have not called me with the results, I have had to chase.
