The inability/reluctance to allow patients to book in advance.  If I currently want to book an appointment I have to go to work (over 20 miles from the surgery), make multiple phone calls after 8:30am to try to speak to someone and then they offer me an appointment in the middle of the morning.  If I could have an evening appointment or book a week in advance I could at least plan for the mid morning appointment.
The car park is small and always very busy.
Could information relevant to patients such as the list of current doctors, appointment times or changes to the appointment system be communicated online.  Currently there is no proactive communication from the surgery, I only find out about changes if I contact the surgery and this needs to be improved.
