If you are lucky in your appointment and get a certain Dr well, they will listen and understand what you explain (up to a certain level). 
If you are unlucky and get the old school type, well, you are in for some trouble. They patronise you in a way that makes you feel inferior (which means they think of themselves as superior).  In three occasions, I was prescribed antibiotics for scratchy throat symptoms (and after I mentioned I had been on the paracetamol for 14 days). Other symptoms included, burning eyes, tiredness, blocked nose.... I am not a GP, they are remember....  A friend of mine (GP) mentioned the probability of an allergy related problem and as soon as I had the symptoms again, I had an appointment with that same Dr.  Diagnosis, sore throat, etc.... Antibiotics (are you allergic to penicillin derivatives... etc. same as usual) , until I mentioned the allergy possibility.  To this point I thought I could become a GP as every time I'd go there I'd get the same treatment...
