I am very surprised that given the difficulties of handing a sick baby that there seems to be little assistance from the reception staff in what can be a stressful time.  Our 5 month old was had some kind of cold or virus and when my wife called to try to get an appointment was told there was nothing available for the next two weeks.  She was advised to turn up for a walk in appointment. The waits for these can be very long and sitting in the reception area with an already sick baby when there are issues with swine flu does not seem to be a very sensible system.  

After refusing to come up with any alternative my wife asked to speak to a Doctor, who called back and told her to turn up later in the afternoon to be seen by a doctor.  She arrived at 3.30pm to be told that she was third on the walk in appointment list and had to wait.  The wait was an hour, so speaking to the Doctor and being asked to come in at a specific time seemed to have no effect.
