The waiting room is quite small and I worry that sneezing patients have the ability to infect me as they are so close. 
The well baby clinic is chaotic and does not seem to be run efficiently. I have seen mothers have to leave to pick up children from school as they have not been seen, but have been there since 1.30pm. I have seen the clinic being held up by patients who have not registered with the clinic and/or do not have an NHS number. I have also seen people pop into the clinic with a child who is unwell, holding the others up (when I tried this, I wasn't allowed to though). 
The check in system is chaotic, and a long line sometimes ensues. Our previous surgery in Birmingham had an machine check in system which was much more efficient. You also have to line up to get a prescription, so a long line makes this more time consuming.
