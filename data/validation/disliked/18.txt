Punctuality is not always great.  However, I was called in early for my last appointment  :)

I am sure more than myself would appreciate a local number to the surgery, as it then would be possible to use inclusive minutes for a mobile phone.  Not everyone can access a work phone in private.  We happen to work in an open space office.
