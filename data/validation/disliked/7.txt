The doctor's attitude seems to lack a level of sympathy that I would expect. A nurse is appalling, often rude and very unhelpful. It always feels as though she is judging you and I've even seen her shout at some patients (for no other reason than impatience). I had to go and see her for a smear test recently and I've never felt more undignified; she seemed like she really didn't want to do it and I know it must not be the nicest thing for her to do, but it wasn't exactly my idea of fun either. She made me feel so uncomfortable and really quite upset. Another time, when I hadn't realised that I was coming to the end of my last contraceptive pill pack and therefore went to get my next precscription late (so didn't start the next pack on time), she told me off! Obviously it was a stupid and forgetful mistake on my part, but it's the only time I have ever done this and being a grown woman, I do not expect to be treated like a child for no reason.
All in all, fairly poor service.
